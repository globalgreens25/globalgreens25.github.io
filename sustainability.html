            <p>NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) is a powerful rocket that provides the foundation to allow humans and cargo to travel beyond low-Earth orbit and eventually to the Moon, Mars and beyond. SLS is designed to be the most capable and advanced launch vehicle ever built, with a maximum lift capacity of over 90 metric tons. This next-generation rocket system utilizes a combination of solid and liquid propulsion stages to provide a safe, reliable and efficient means of access to deep space. The SLS is designed to be flexible, scalable and sustainable, meaning it can be configured for a variety of missions with different capabilities, depending on the needs of the mission. It is also designed to be reusable, reducing the cost of future missions and making space travel more accessible. With its unparalleled power and versatility, SLS will not only pave the way for NASA's continued space exploration, but also for you as you journey into space with Armstrong.</p>

            <p>Extra-Vehicular Activity(EVA) Suits work to protect astronauts from the harsh conditions of space, including temperatures ranging from -250 to 250 degrees Fahrenheit, high-energy radiation, debris, and more. According to NASA, our partner organization, space suits consist of 7 distinct elements: the cooling garment and other flexible layers, the hard upper torso(HUT), the gloves, the lower torso, the portable life support system(PLSS), the communications cap, and the helmet. The cooling garment is the first layer of the spacesuit. The spandex layer is covered with tubes of cool water, which regulate the astronaut's temperature. On top of the cooling garment, EVA suits can include up to 16 different layers to hold oxygen, maintain a habitable pressure, shield from dust, and other functions. The HUT is a durable, lightweight shell that links the functions of the PLSS to the inside of the space suit and provides openings for the rest of the suit to attach to. The gloves of the EVA suit provide protection and temperature regulation to the fingers. The pants and boots of the EVA suit keep the legs and feet protected and warm while the waist provides attachment points for tethers and other tools. The PLSS, typically worn as a backpack on the back of the EVA suits, is a group of systems that work together to maintain an optimal environment for the astronaut within the space suit through regulating pressuring, filtering oxygen, and monitoring vitals. The communicational cap, often called the Snoopy cap, holds the astronaut’s earphones and microphones and connects to the spacesuit's radio. Through the cap, astronauts can communicate with each other and mission control. Finally, the helmet is formed of a plastic bubble, a protective visor, and the sun visor and shades. The intricate elements of the helmet help maintain the pressure and oxygen levels of the suit and protect against the sun’s intense rays. With the help of our EVA suits, we here at Armstrong do everything to make sure your future adventures are filled with excitement and safety.</p>
